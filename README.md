# Regression
Hi 

Thanks for visiting my Regression Repository. 

In this repository, I learn how to 

1. predict who survived on the titanic dataset
2. predict boston housing prices with Neural network (NN)
3. predict medical charges with linear regression
4. predict Rossmann store sales from kaggle
5. predict Rossman store sales from kaggle using Gradient Boosting Machines with XGBoost

This tutorial was from freecodecamp & 2 day courses.

# Regression
Hi 

Thanks for visiting my Regression Repository. 

In this repository, I learn how to predict

1. who survived on the titanic dataset
2. boston housing prices with Neural network (NN)
3. medical charges with linear regression
4. Rossmann store sales from kaggle
5. Rossman store sales from kaggle using Gradient Boosting Machines with XGBoost
6. new york city taxi fare

This tutorial was from freecodecamp, 2 day courses, and kaggle.
